# Responsive Navbar Project

A simple, responsive navigation bar built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It adapts to different screen sizes and includes a toggleable mobile menu using the hamburger (`☰`) and close (`✖`) icons.

## 🛠️ Features

- Fully responsive design
- Mobile-first navigation menu
- Hamburger menu using Font Awesome icons
- Clean hover effects and blur background for pop-out menu
- Easy to customize


## 🚀 How It Works

- The desktop view shows the navigation links inline.
- On smaller screens (≤768px), links are hidden and replaced by a hamburger icon.
- Clicking the hamburger icon displays a blurred, fixed-position menu.
- A close icon (`×`) hides the menu again.

## 📲 Responsive Design

- Uses a `@media` query to adjust navbar behavior for screen widths under 768px.
- Mobile menu appears as a popup with blur and shadow effects.
